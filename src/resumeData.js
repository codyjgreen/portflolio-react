I got into software development during my first year as a stay at home dad I have always been a tinkerer and love to solve problems with technology. So I decided to dive right in and started going to school at night while being a stay at home dad during the day and it was something that was incredibly tough but it is something that I am extremely proud of. Have something you want broken and put back together? I'd love to work with you.",
